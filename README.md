Brute Force Ceaser Cipher Decrypter
Like what more to be said. 
It has customizable front shifts and ranges so like you can cover a better range of characters. 

Uses the inbuilt pyton chr() and ord() functions (based on the unicode value of the characters). 

Im making a vigenere cipher one as well, hopefully that goes well.
